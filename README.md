# DHCP Spoofing Lab.
The Purpose of this lab is to experiment with DHCP Spoofing using the Ettercap Program on Linux. DHCP Spoofing is a "man in the middle" attack used to intercept packets from users on the network. These packets can give hackers valuable information such as login credentials as seen in this lab.

First we will open Ettercap and start a Unified Sniffing on the network we want to DHCP Spoof on.
